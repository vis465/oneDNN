## Project overview
**Medical Image Processing - Pneumonia classification**

   Pneumonia is a prevalent respiratory infection that requires accurate and timely
diagnosis for effective treatment. In our project, we utilized SYCL, a programming model based on standard C++,
for the classification of pneumonia in medical image processing. SYCL served as the foundation for our pneumonia classification project,
leveraging the power of heterogeneous hardware architectures, such as CPUs,
GPUs, and FPGAs.With SYCL, we optimized our classification algorithms for parallel processing, enabling faster and more accurate diagnosis

# üìç What is OneAPI

   OneAPI is an open, standards-based, cross-architecture programming model developed by the oneAPI consortium, which is led by Intel. This initiative aims to simplify the development of high-performance, heterogeneous applications that can run on a variety of hardware architectures, including CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, and other accelerators. It's designed to address the challenges of modern computing, where hardware diversity is increasing, and software needs to be optimized for different types of processors.

# üìçoneDNN
oneAPI Deep Neural Network Library (oneDNN)
===========================================

<img align="left" src="https://spec.oneapi.io/oneapi-logo-white-scaled.jpg" alt="oneAPI logo">

oneAPI Deep Neural Network Library (oneDNN) is an open-source cross-platform
performance library of basic building blocks for deep learning applications.
oneDNN is part of oneAPI.
The library is optimized for Intel(R) Architecture Processors, Intel Graphics,
and Arm\* 64-bit Architecture (AArch64)-based processors. oneDNN has
experimental support for the following architectures: NVIDIA\* GPU,
AMD\* GPU, OpenPOWER\* Power ISA (PPC64), IBMz\* (s390x), and RISC-V.

oneDNN is intended for deep learning applications and framework
developers interested in improving application performance on CPUs and GPUs.
Deep learning practitioners should use one of the
applications enabled with oneDNN.
